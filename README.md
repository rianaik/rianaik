- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rianaik
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Automation. I have worked with GitLab, Selenium, Java(my "not-so arch-nemesis" :wink:), RestAssured, Playwright, JavaScript(basics) and Appium to automate the testing.
- I have a keen interest in Shell-Scripting (need to refine the skills though) and love to work with it.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently sharpening my skills of scripting and writing more precise and refined tests.
- I love trying out different tools for the testing purpose and for fun.
- Checkout my **blog** where I have shared my technical journey. [medium/@rianaik](https://medium.com/@rianaik)
